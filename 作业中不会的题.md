### Q4: Count coins

Given a positive integer `total`, a set of coins makes change for `total` if the sum of the values of the coins is `total`. Here we will use standard US Coin values: 1, 5, 10, 25 For example, the following sets make change for `15`:

- 15 1-cent coins
- 10 1-cent, 1 5-cent coins
- 5 1-cent, 2 5-cent coins
- 5 1-cent, 1 10-cent coins
- 3 5-cent coins
- 1 5-cent, 1 10-cent coin

Thus, there are 6 ways to make change for `15`. Write a recursive function `count_coins` that takes a positive integer `total` and returns the number of ways to make change for `total` using coins. Use the `next_largest_coin` function given to you to calculate the next largest coin denomination given your current coin. I.e. `next_largest_coin(5)` = `10`.

> *Hint:* Refer the [implementation](http://composingprograms.com/pages/17-recursive-functions.html#example-partitions) of `count_partitions` for an example of how to count the ways to sum up to a total with smaller parts. If you need to keep track of more than one value across recursive calls, consider writing a helper function.

```python
def next_largest_coin(coin):
    """Return the next coin. 
    >>> next_largest_coin(1)
    5
    >>> next_largest_coin(5)
    10
    >>> next_largest_coin(10)
    25
    >>> next_largest_coin(2) # Other values return None
    """
    if coin == 1:
        return 5
    elif coin == 5:
        return 10
    elif coin == 10:
        return 25

def count_coins(total):
    """Return the number of ways to make change for total using coins of value of 1, 5, 10, 25.
    >>> count_coins(15)
    6
    >>> count_coins(10)
    4
    >>> count_coins(20)
    9
    >>> count_coins(100) # How many ways to make change for a dollar?
    242
    >>> from construct_check import check
    >>> # ban iteration
    >>> check(HW_SOURCE_FILE, 'count_coins', ['While', 'For'])                                          
    True
    """
